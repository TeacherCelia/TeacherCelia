# 👩‍💻 Celia Pérez | Junior Software Developer

Hi there! I'm a **software developer in the making**, eager to grow in the world of software development. While I'm just starting my journey in this field, I have a strong background in **teaching programming fundamentals through robotics**.  

🔹 6+ years' experience in **Arduino-based embedded programming (C/C++)**, teaching and developing robotics and IoT educational projects using sensors, actuators, and serial communication.

💼 Recently completed my internship at a mobile app company (Arkana)

📲 Passionate about building mobile apps — both native and hybrid (although I think native is better...😝)

📚 Always learning: currently focusing on **React Native**, and excited to **build and share** projects.  

## 🛠 Technologies I feel confident with  
### 📱 Mobile Development
- **Android** → Kotlin | Jetpack | Gradle
- **iOS** → Swift | SwiftUI | CocoaPods
- **Multiplatform** → Flutter | React Native *(learning in progress)*

### 🗃️ Databases
- Firebase (Auth + Realtime Database)
- SQLite
- MySQL

### 🧰 Other Tools
- Java → My first POO language 🩵
- Python
- Git & GitHub
- Android Studio | Xcode | Visual Studio Code
- Figma | Lucidchart | Arduino

## 💡 Featured Project

[`EggStat`](https://github.com/TeacherCelia/EggStat) 🐣 → Native Android app for managing school henhouse tasks. Developed as my final project for DAM studies, using **Kotlin** + **Firebase** (auth + realtime database).

## 🧠 Mindset

I'm a naturally **curious** and **proactive** person who loves turning ideas into real, functional apps. **Creativity** drives how I approach problems, always looking for practical and user-friendly solutions.

I work well both independently and as part of a team, and I genuinely enjoy **collaborating with others** — whether it’s brainstorming with colleagues or supporting clients. My background in education taught me how to explain complex things simply, and to always listen and adapt.

I'm excited to **keep learning** and growing as a developer, and I’m looking for a team where I can contribute, learn from others, and help build meaningful projects together.
